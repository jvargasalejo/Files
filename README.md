Prueba Tecnica:

In order to be assessed by the Globant's Data Science team, we encourage you to develop the following test in order to see your Data Scientist skills properly and how well you resolve a common data science task.
In this dataset dataset you have 3 different outputs:
No readmission;
A readmission in less than 30 days (this situation is not good, because maybe your treatment was not appropriate);
A readmission in more than 30 days (this one is not so good as well the last one, however, the reason could be the state of the patient.
Your task is either to classify a patient-hospital outcome or to cluster them aiming at finding patterns that give a distinct insight.
To do so, we suggest you create a notebook, like Jupyter (if you use python) or a Rmarkdown report (in case you use R) and make it available for us, i.e. github.
Hint to success in your quest: Develop and stay clear of the data science process you'll perform over the dataset and highlight important aspects you might consider affordable to discuss over.
You have up to a day before the technical interview to share your results of this test.
